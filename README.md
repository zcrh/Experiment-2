# PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT 2
## NUMERICAL PYTHON (NUMPY)
The core Python library for scientific computing is called NumPy. A multidimensional array object, different derived objects, and a variety of routines for quick array operations‚Äîlike sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation, and much more‚Äîare all provided by this Python library.


### I. Intended Learning Outcomes:
  1. To identify the codes and functions incorporated in the Numpy library
  2. To be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program using a
    Numpy library

### II. Instructions:
Write a Python script/code in the Jupyter Notebook to do the given problems. You may submit your Jupyter
notebook in the dedicated submission bin.

## **_1. NORMALIZATION PROBLEM_** 
Normalization is one of the most basic preprocessing techniques in data analytics. This involves centering and scaling process. Centering means subtracting the data from the
mean and scaling means dividing with its standard deviation. Mathematically, normalization can be
expressed as:

In Python, element-wise mean and element-wise standard deviation can be obtained by using .mean() and
.std() calls. In this problem, create a random 5 x 5 ndarray and store it to variable X. Normalize X. Save your normalized
ndarray as X_normalized.npy

### In this project, we:
- Create a random 5x5 matrix using `numpy`.
- Normalize the matrix using the mean and standard deviation of its elements.
- Save the normalized matrix as a `.npy` file.

### üñ•Ô∏è INPUT CODE:
```python
# This line provides support for arrays or multidimensional array (ndarray)
import numpy as np

# Create a random 5x5 ndarray, storing it into X and then display
X = np.random.rand(5, 5)
print("Random 5x5 ndarray: ")
print(X)

# Calculating the mean and standard deviation of X
mean_of_X = X.mean()
std_of_X = X.std()

# Normalizing X using the given formula and displaying the result
X_normalized = (X - mean_of_X) / std_of_X
print("\nNormalized X: ")
print(X_normalized)

# Save the normalized ndarray 
np.save('X_normalized.npy', X_normalized)

```
### üèÅ EXPECTED OUTPUT:
```
Random 5x5 ndarray:

    A = np.square(np.arange(1,101).reshape(10,10))
